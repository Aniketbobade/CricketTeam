Having proved his mettle with the bat aagainst all opposition n all pitches, the Delhi basher has emerged as a true successor to the legendary Sachin Tendulkar. Kohli has proved to be a tru leader in every since and with MS Dhoni calling it quits from all formats, Kohli has taken over he mantle of captaincy and has adjusted himself well to it.",

It was later revealed that he had played through that entire tournament - and the preceding Test series against the hosts, essentially four months - through a knee injury. His success can be attributed to his pace, accuracy and primarily his skill in moving the ball - both old and new.",
